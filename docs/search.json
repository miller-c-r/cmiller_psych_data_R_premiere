The analyses that would be useful when working in a real-world setting and also collaborative benefits of using R versus other languages.\nVisualizing data in R , and becoming more comfortable with syntax of a new language are the reasons I decided this course would benefit me."

Each experiment produced a number of replicate estimates of g using the same methodology. Although the basic method remained the same for all experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in configuration.\nThe gravity data frame contains the data from all eight experiments. The grav data frame contains the data from the experiments 7 and 8. The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000 in centimetres per second squared.”\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nggplot(data = gravity) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = g, y =series))"
