"Tip 1. storing a value in a variable"

x <- "Chantal"

print("Tip 2. The function 'c' ")

y <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

# the function c will combine the values in the parentheses
print(y)

"Tip 3. Calculating a mean, the difference between text and numerical data"

# cannot calculate mean("1", "2", "3", "4")

#convert to numerical data:

#function arguments

#sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
