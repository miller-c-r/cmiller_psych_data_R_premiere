In an attempt to learn data analysis the R programming language is mentioned often. Yet it seems to be far less commonly taught than a more prevalent data science language Python.

In this blog entry I will write what my goals are for the next few months of this course.

I would like to spend time on applied data science, such as practical uses for R. The analyses that would be useful when working in a real-world setting and also collaborative benefits of using R versus other languages.

Visualizing data in R , and becoming more comfortable with syntax of a new language are the reasons I decided this course would benefit me.
